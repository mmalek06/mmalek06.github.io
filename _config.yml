description: "Welcome to my blog, where I document my daily encounters with a wide range of technologies. From web frameworks (both frontend and backend) to AWS, Azure, Machine Learning & AI, and DevOps, I cover it all. As a technological polyglot, I've worked with and learned about an extensive array of technologies. This blog serves as a personal repository to help me remember and share my experiences."
