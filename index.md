This is a blog about everything I encounter daily - web frameworks, both frontend and backed, AWS, Azure, Machine Learning & AI, DevOps. Since I'm a 
technological polyglot, the list of technologies I worked with, or learned about is very long, and the main purpose of this blog is to help me remember.
